# Income-Specific Footprints Analysis

This project contains notebooks and data for analyzing income-specific footprints for German households. It is part of the Industrial Ecology Open Online Course (IEooc) from the University of Freiburg, see here: https://www.industrialecology.uni-freiburg.de/teaching. 
The analysis includes calculating income-specific GHG footprints for Germany and estimating the uncertainty using Monte-Carlo simulations. 




## Notebooks

- **IEooc_Methods5_Exercise4a_calculate_income_specific_footprints_SOLUTION.ipynb**: Solution notebook for calculating income-specific footprints.
- **IEooc_Methods5_Exercise4a_calculate_income_specific_footprints_TODO.ipynb**: To-do notebook for calculating income-specific footprints.
- **IEooc_Methods5_Exercise4b_uncertainty_analysis_SOLUTION.ipynb**: Solution notebook for estimating the uncertainty of income-specific footprints using Monte-Carlo simulations.
- **IEooc_Methods5_Exercise4b_uncertainty_analysis_TODO.ipynb**: To-do notebook for estimating the uncertainty of income-specific footprints using Monte-Carlo simulations.

## Data

- **Final_demand_by_income_avg.xlsx**: Average final demand by income group.
- **Final_demand_by_income_std.xlsx**: Standard deviation of final demand by income group.

## Requirements

Install the required Python packages using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

1. Install all dependencies
2. Open the Exercise descriptions (.docx) and follow the instructions. 

## Acknowledgment

The exercise builds on material from the course "Supply chain modelling, indicators, and responsibility" and was developed by Simon Schulte and Dr. Johan Velez under supervision of Prof. Stefan Pauliuk. 

It makes use of data from the following publication:
